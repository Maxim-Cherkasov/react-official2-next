//* Copying objects with the spread syntax

// Wrong example

// these input fields don’t work because the onChange handlers mutate the state:

// For example, this line mutates the state from a past render:
// person.firstName = e.target.value;

In the previous example, the position object is always created fresh from the current cursor position. But often, you will want to include existing data as a part of the new object you’re creating. For example, you may want to update only one field in a form, but keep the previous values for all other fields.

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: "Barbara",
    lastName: "Hepworth",
    email: "bhepworth@sculpture.com",
  });

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    person.firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    person.lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e) {
    person.email = e.target.value;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input value={person.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input value={person.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input value={person.email} onChange={handleEmailChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName} {person.lastName} ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

The reliable way to get the behavior you’re looking for is to create a new object and pass it to setPerson. But here, you want to also copy the existing data into it because only one of the fields has changed:

setPerson({
  firstName: e.target.value, // New first name from the input
  lastName: person.lastName,
  email: person.email
});


You can use the ... object spread syntax so that you don’t need to copy every property separately.

setPerson({
  ...person, // Copy the old fields
  firstName: e.target.value // But override this one
});


Now the form works!

Notice how you didn’t declare a separate state variable for each input field. For large forms, keeping all data grouped in an object is very convenient—as long as you update it correctly!

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      firstName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      lastName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      email: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          value={person.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          value={person.email}
          onChange={handleEmailChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName}{' '}
        {person.lastName}{' '}
        ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

Note that the ... spread syntax is “shallow”—it only copies things one level deep. This makes it fast, but it also means that if you want to update a nested property, you’ll have to use it more than once.

//* Using a single event handler for multiple fields 

Hide Details
You can also use the [ and ] braces inside your object definition to specify a property with dynamic name. Here is the same example, but with a single event handler instead of three different ones:

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  function handleChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      [e.target.name]: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          name="firstName"
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          name="lastName"
          value={person.lastName}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          name="email"
          value={person.email}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName}{' '}
        {person.lastName}{' '}
        ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

//* Updating a nested object 
// Consider a nested object structure like this:

const [person, setPerson] = useState({
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: {
    title: 'Blue Nana',
    city: 'Hamburg',
    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
  }
});
If you wanted to update person.artwork.city, it’s clear how to do it with mutation:

person.artwork.city = 'New Delhi';

 But in React, you treat state as immutable! In order to change city, you would first need to produce the new artwork object (pre-populated with data from the previous one), and then produce the new person object which points at the new artwork:

const nextArtwork = { ...person.artwork, city: 'New Delhi' };
const nextPerson = { ...person, artwork: nextArtwork };
setPerson(nextPerson);

Or, written as a single function call:

setPerson({
  ...person, // Copy other fields
  artwork: { // but replace the artwork
    ...person.artwork, // with the same one
    city: 'New Delhi' // but in New Delhi!
  }
});

This gets a bit wordy, but it works fine for many cases:


import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
    artwork: {
      title: 'Blue Nana',
      city: 'Hamburg',
      image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
    }
  });

  function handleNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      name: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleTitleChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        title: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  function handleCityChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        city: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  function handleImageChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        image: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          value={person.name}
          onChange={handleNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Title:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.title}
          onChange={handleTitleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        City:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.city}
          onChange={handleCityChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Image:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.image}
          onChange={handleImageChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        <i>{person.artwork.title}</i>
        {' by '}
        {person.name}
        <br />
        (located in {person.artwork.city})
      </p>
      <img 
        src={person.artwork.image} 
        alt={person.artwork.title}
      />
    </>
  );
}

//* An object like this appears “nested” in code:

let obj = {
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: {
    title: 'Blue Nana',
    city: 'Hamburg',
    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
  }
};

However, “nesting” is an inaccurate way to think about how objects behave. When the code executes, there is no such thing as a “nested” object. You are really looking at two different objects:

let obj1 = {
  title: 'Blue Nana',
  city: 'Hamburg',
  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
};

let obj2 = {
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: obj1
};

The obj1 object is not “inside” obj2. For example, obj3 could “point” at obj1 too:

let obj1 = {
  title: 'Blue Nana',
  city: 'Hamburg',
  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
};

let obj2 = {
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: obj1
};

let obj3 = {
  name: 'Copycat',
  artwork: obj1
};

If you were to mutate obj3.artwork.city, it would affect both obj2.artwork.city and obj1.city. This is because obj3.artwork, obj2.artwork, and obj1 are the same object. This is difficult to see when you think of objects as “nested”. Instead, they are separate objects “pointing” at each other with properties.

//* Write concise update logic with Immer 
If your state is deeply nested, you might want to consider flattening it. But, if you don’t want to change your state structure, you might prefer a shortcut to nested spreads. Immer is a popular library that lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you. With Immer, the code you write looks like you are “breaking the rules” and mutating an object:

updatePerson(draft => {
  draft.artwork.city = 'Lagos';
});
But unlike a regular mutation, it doesn’t overwrite the past state!

But unlike a regular mutation, it doesn’t overwrite the past state!

DEEP DIVE
How does Immer work? 

Hide Details
The draft provided by Immer is a special type of object, called a Proxy, that “records” what you do with it. This is why you can mutate it freely as much as you like! Under the hood, Immer figures out which parts of the draft have been changed, and produces a completely new object that contains your edits.

To try Immer:

Run npm install use-immer to add Immer as a dependency
Then replace import { useState } from 'react' with import { useImmer } from 'use-immer'
Here is the above example converted to Immer:

import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, updatePerson] = useImmer({
    name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
    artwork: {
      title: 'Blue Nana',
      city: 'Hamburg',
      image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
    }
  });

  function handleNameChange(e) {
    updatePerson(draft => {
      draft.name = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  function handleTitleChange(e) {
    updatePerson(draft => {
      draft.artwork.title = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  function handleCityChange(e) {
    updatePerson(draft => {
      draft.artwork.city = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  function handleImageChange(e) {
    updatePerson(draft => {
      draft.artwork.image = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          value={person.name}
          onChange={handleNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Title:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.title}
          onChange={handleTitleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        City:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.city}
          onChange={handleCityChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Image:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.image}
          onChange={handleImageChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        <i>{person.artwork.title}</i>
        {' by '}
        {person.name}
        <br />
        (located in {person.artwork.city})
      </p>
      <img 
        src={person.artwork.image} 
        alt={person.artwork.title}
      />
    </>
  );
}

Notice how much more concise the event handlers have become. You can mix and match useState and useImmer in a single component as much as you like. Immer is a great way to keep the update handlers concise, especially if there’s nesting in your state, and copying objects leads to repetitive code.

Why is mutating state not recommended in React? 

Hide Details
There are a few reasons:

Debugging: If you use console.log and don’t mutate state, your past logs won’t get clobbered by the more recent state changes. So you can clearly see how state has changed between renders.

Optimizations: Common React optimization strategies rely on skipping work if previous props or state are the same as the next ones. If you never mutate state, it is very fast to check whether there were any changes. If prevObj === obj, you can be sure that nothing could have changed inside of it.

New Features: The new React features we’re building rely on state being treated like a snapshot. If you’re mutating past versions of state, that may prevent you from using the new features.

Requirement Changes: Some application features, like implementing Undo/Redo, showing a history of changes, or letting the user reset a form to earlier values, are easier to do when nothing is mutated. This is because you can keep past copies of state in memory, and reuse them when appropriate. If you start with a mutative approach, features like this can be difficult to add later on.

Simpler Implementation: Because React does not rely on mutation, it does not need to do anything special with your objects. It does not need to hijack their properties, always wrap them into Proxies, or do other work at initialization as many “reactive” solutions do. This is also why React lets you put any object into state—no matter how large—without additional performance or correctness pitfalls.
In practice, you can often “get away” with mutating state in React, but we strongly advise you not to do that so that you can use new React features developed with this approach in mind. Future contributors and perhaps even your future self will thank you!

Recap
Treat all state in React as immutable.

When you store objects in state, mutating them will not trigger renders and will change the state in previous render “snapshots”.

Instead of mutating an object, create a new version of it, and trigger a re-render by setting state to it.
You can use the {...obj, something: 'newValue'} object spread syntax to create copies of objects.
Spread syntax is shallow: it only copies one level deep.
To update a nested object, you need to create copies all the way up from the place you’re updating.
To reduce repetitive copying code, use Immer.

  );
}

//* Docs solution

 The problem with handlePlusClick was that it mutated the player object. As a result, React did not know that there’s a reason to re-render, and did not update the score on the screen. This is why, when you edited the first name, the state got updated, triggering a re-render which also updated the score on the screen.

The problem with handleLastNameChange was that it did not copy the existing ...player fields into the new object. This is why the score got lost after you edited the last name.

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Scoreboard() {
  const [player, setPlayer] = useState({
    firstName: 'Ranjani',
    lastName: 'Shettar',
    score: 10,
  });

  function handlePlusClick() {
    setPlayer({
      ...player,
      score: player.score + 1,
    });
  }

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPlayer({
      ...player,
